    Do you remember Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and its infamous "here we go again" meme? Well, I must admit it's starting to feel somehow similar to that emblematic moment, but now that I (hopefully) have your attention, and just like it recently happened with my little [ChromatOS](https://github.com/JuditKaramazov/Codetopia-ChromatOS), today we're introducing noctOS. As it previously happened with its big brother, today's project works as part of this fall's Codetopia, inspired by Africa’s first annual destination Indie Games & Immersive Arts festival and conference [Playtopia](https://playtopiafestival.co.za/about/). "Why so many 'Codetopias', and 'Summer Code Fests', and some other bunch of strange labels, Judit?" First of all, it truly helps me organize my ideas and keep track of my progress; and it's an indirect way of supporting events related to spheres that I truly enjoy, too. Finally, this is nothing more than an excuse to let you know that all these projects prove that I am still learning and practicing the basics I couldn't explore during my formation - as well as getting to know better different technologies, languages, frameworks and tools allowing me to solve my every day's mundanities.
    
    Not long ago, we discussed how much Apple restricts the customization of system elements like folder colors for consistency, coherency, and security. This strong, perfectly-solid brand identity has been at the core of Apple’s success, and with it, the emblematic half-eaten-fruit managed to win new enthusiasts while solidifying the relationship with existing ones. Innovation, quality customer service, captivating marketing campaigns that resonate with its audience... Marketing has changed because the world has changed, and while many people in this industry have become overwhelmed and paralyzed by the blizzard of technology that's literally upon us, entrepreneurs and engineers have been able to forge new businesses and disrupt, or create, markets. "Es el mercado, amigo."
    
    Although we all have to admit that, at a meta level, each of these businesses - Apple included - demonstrated an absurd degree of coherence between their multiple departments (perfectly aligned, like a living organism), it's still lame to exist within some boundaries when, paradoxically, choice and control have been the preferred labels of most of these companies finding customization not so representative of concepts such as "value" and "integrity". What do we truly value as individuals, in the end? Quite a difficult question, this one. In my case, and after reflecting on the ideas that I explored in my last (and colorful) project of the kind, I would say that customization and (at least the fiction of) freedom of choice are indeed essential, and I do appreciate having a minimum control over how things work - and when. Why would that be so crucial, especially in the digital era? Here's a short explanation of it:

    1. In a world of predefined defaults, the power of choice and freedom is unparalleled - and there's no way we refuse to mold our digital spaces in order to mirror the complexities of our evolving identities.
    2. Much like colors in the physical realm, the colors of our digital environment are personal expressions unique to us. Imagine launching your creative apps under an inspiring theme or your productivity tools under a focused ambiance. It's not just about organizing; it's about creating an emotional connection with your digital space.
    3. In an era where the expression of identity remains both blurred and resoundingly powerful, and now that algorithms often curate our experiences, customization becomes a tool for reclaiming control and asserting individuality.
    4. No matter how much the distinction between analog and digital identities is diminishing, the concept of "self" is paramount, and our devices should adapt to our preferences, not the other way around (not even your Apple device is excluded from this list, dear stranger).
    5. As stated in ChromatOS, MacBooks are cool - but they could be cool, colorful, and more customizable.

    Considering this, and due to this never-ending rapture pushing me to allow other individuals (including myself, this time) to make their devices into digital sanctuaries, I decided to create a Swift application empowering users to personalize their macOS experience by easily setting a light or dark mode theme for their chosen applications.

    The ability to switch themes and colors can still become a reflection of the dynamic nature of the self, can't it?

    Although this tendenceny of including my repositories into imaginary gaming/dev events has become one of this GitHub account's main habits, this time (and due to some variations regarding my purposes and goals), ChromatOS works as part of this fall's Codetopia, inspired by Africa's first annual destination Indie Games & Immersive Arts festival and conference [Playtopia](https://playtopiafestival.co.za/about/). Initially aiming at practicing the basics I couldn't explore during my formation, I must admit that I am still learning (of course!), but also exploring the many technologies, languages, frameworks and tools fitting my needs and (generally deceiving) ideas better.
    
    In this case, and since my life changed quite a bit these last months, I recently discussed with my roommate how much Apple restricts customization of system elements like folder colors for consistency, coherency and security. After having a look at the devices that we have at home, it's undeniable that customizing icons and folders in macOS may be more accessible compared to iPadOS as macOS allows more flexibility for system customization and integration with custom extensions or code. iPadOS, on the other hand, is more locked down and restricts extensive customization, especially when it comes to system-level changes.

    The conclusion, of course, was a mutual "that's lame" moment, but even though these restrictions are a (sad) reality we can't possibly overcome, talking about how great it would be to allow users for this extra customization is an idea that I couldn't get out of my mind. Why couldn't I? Because as it happens to the best of us, my brain strictly follows the patterns and logic processes that allow me to keep some order up there, just like it usually happens when organizing our notes with colors. Colors? Yes, colors, and here's a little explanation of their importance and benefits:
    
    1. Colors serve as visual cues that help users quickly identify and categorize items. When applied to folders, they make it easier to distinguish between different types of content or projects at a glance.
    2. Colors can trigger memory associations. When users assign specific colors to folders, they can establish a color-coding system that aids in remembering the contents or significance of each folder. For example, red folders might represent urgent or high-priority tasks, while blue folders could signify personal (or just Apple-related) projects.
    3. A well-organized visual system reduces cognitive load. Users don't need to remember folder names or dig through numerous directories. Instead, they can rely on the visual cues provided by colors.
    4. Beyond the practical benefits, color customization adds an aesthetic dimension to literally everything - and the macOS experience is no exception.
    5. MacBooks are cool - but they could be cool and colorful.

    Considering this, and due to this sudden urge of allowing other individuals (my roommate, more specifically) to make their desktop and Finder environment more visually pleasing, I decided to create a Swift Apple Finder extension empowering users to personalize their macOS experience by easily changing folder colors.

  description: |
    This project was part of the Summer Code Fest (inspired by the "Summer Game Fest" - again!) and aimed to practice the basics of TypeScript, React Native, and Expo CLI.

    In this case, and since one of the main subjects affecting my life while coding gravitated around the idea of moving out, I decided to create an application focused on the one and only reality we should all embrace and rely on as functional adults: plants.

    1. Just like roommates, they are the perfect allies whenever our scenarios change so drastically - and just like them, they require time, nutrients and the proper environment.
    2. They can be as small and portable as our dearly beloved mobile devices.
    3. Above all, they force us to stick to a well-organized lifestyle, and nothing workings better for it than reminders and notifications.

    Considering this, and since I wanted to keep learning and practicing TypeScript independently of my external circumstances, creating a customized React Native application inspired by my new condition, my roommate's passion for plants, and our overall lack of time management felt like the only possible solution. 
    
    Why React Native, though? In all honesty, and due to the convoluted nature of our daily lives, it seemed appropriate to make Plan(t) Your Life fit in our pockets; this way, we won't forget to pay attention to what truly matters to us.

    This project was part of the Summer Code Fest (inspired by the "Summer Game Fest", probably one of the most terrible ideas we ever had as a society), and aimed to practice the basics I couldn't explore in IT Academy's bootcamp. In this case, and after giving Next.js a try by creating a small [Spotify Replica](https://github.com/JuditKaramazov/SummerCodeFest-Spotify), I focused on some of the subjects mattering the most both to me and most of the Spanish citizens: 

    1. The difficulty to stay focused during the summer.
    2. The unsettling feeling our 2023 elections were eliciting from us.
    3. The relevant figure of Mariano Rajoy, which wasn't so great whenever politics were involved, but that became essential from a comical standpoint.
    4. The importance of learning and practicing TypeScript (maybe this isn't affecting the entire country, but it still is a crucial matter).

    Considering this, I created a customized [M. Pomodoro Rajoy Timer](https://m-pomodoro-rajoy.vercel.app/) greatly inspired by some of our ex-president's most memorable quotes. 
    
    Why? Because we all need to find the strength and courage to focus on our goals, wants, and wishes, and I believe that some of his emblematic sentences could fuel our spirit during difficult times. However, I do consider it essential to highlight that the intention of this small app is not based on attacking various ideologies and positions. Far the contrary, I would want this space to bring a smile to the ones struggling with their studies, work, and overall time management.

    The project provided a Spotify interface and allowed users to explore and interact with various Spotify features:

    1. Login page and authentication using Spotify credentials.
    2. User's libraries, including playlists, liked songs, and more.
    3. Featured playlists and artists recommended by Spotify.
    4. Search bar to search for songs, artists, albums, and playlists.

    Please note that while most of Spotify's features are available, some functionalities are still under development and will be added in the future! However, I still found it a nice practice to get to understand better some tools I wasn't familiarized with.

    Not so long ago, I went on a journey that took me to Upper Austria, which is considerably far away from my country, both geographically and mentally speaking. The only thing that I metaphorically took with me was this vague, distant story about my grandmother moving to Germany after our Civil War had finished, with no German knowledge nor any sort of proper formation. The only thing that she kept with her was the urge of finding a stable job that would eventually allow her to come back to our country and take back her life. Even though our situations were drastically different, I could still feel this deep connection with all the German-speaking countries, their reality, and the idea that I created about it in my mind.

    expaTICs came to mind some weeks ago, back in my country, and still reminding a conversation that I had with my dear Paulita in Austria: the expat experience can be a solitary, painful path, independently of how connected we seem to be these days.

    Although this wasn't my case, the critical challenge of migration and displacement is as undeniable as the need to coordinate solutions at local, regional, and global levels. Unfortunately, that's far beyond my capabilities; however, I thought that a little application as my final project would be a nice tribute to give to everyone that deconstructed and had to build again their realities - not to mention all the people that I met during my personal journey.
    
    If you are still wondering why expaTICs exists, allow me to highlight another reason: I probably would have never started programming if it wasn't thanks to the scholarship that I got during my stay in Austria. That's the very essence of expaTICs:
    
    1. a representation of the expatriates' journey
    2. the possibilities that go along with it (allowing me to start a TIC formation, in my case)
    
    merged together.

    The combination of these two ideas resulted in the following utilities and features:
    
    1. The usage of OpenAI API.
    2. User management, implemented thanks to Firebase authentication system combined with localStorage.
    3. Private routes granting users free access to the site's landing page, as well as the login, sign up and restore password sections of it, but preventing them from accessing the Dashboard (our application's very core) without previous registration.
    4. The possibility of editing their own data individually (e.g. a color tracker tool that's only accessible to its owner) or openly (e.g. a pseudo-wiki allowing users to collectively craft and deploy notes regarding best places, events, activities, etc.).
    5. The integration of different sections focused on the users and their psychological well-being.

  slug: Sprint8
  description: |
    In all sincerity, I never connected with the idea of communities congregating to share their love and criticism of a specific multimedia work, no matter how passionate I am about certain artistic artifacts. This passion always existed deep within, as a silent one, and just as the "daughter of my generation" that I am, the scope of this passion was remarkably reduced to (and highly influenced by) the decade of the 90s and its most relevant media, films, games and pop culture.
    
    Star Wars was never a solid reference according to my relationship to the collective imaginary, though; however, its influence is as undeniable as it has been well-established and consolidated through the years, and that's probably why IT Academy asked us to work on a project related to this specific universe.

    The final result should fetch each starship's data (including films and pilots) from the SWAPI Star Wars API (https://swapi.dev/) while combining it with the visual assets provided by https://starwars-visualguide.com/. After accessing an entire list located in the Starships section, the user can check all the information fetched with Axios, which is the HTTP client-based package I decided to use in order to communicate and send requests to the REST endpoints.
    
    Although the simplicity of the application is what seems to be an undeniable reality, there was, of course, a little extra: it was necessary to incorporate a registration system and protected routes just so only registered users could access the exclusive content. In order to achieve it, I had to work on the following utilities:
    
    1. The already mentioned Star Wars APIs.
    2. User management, implemented thanks to localStorage usage.
    3. A Sign Up, Login and Sign Out system keeping track of new users, unregistered, and already registered ones, which allows the user to sign up, log in, finish their session and still keep their information stored. As you can see in the previous image, the site greets the registered users by displaying their names on the screen.
    4. Private routes granting users free access to Home (a so-called "welcome page" with a slider integrated) and the About section, but showing an alert and preventing them from accessing the Starships one without previous registration.
    5. An infinite scroll system followed by different "Loading..." or "All starships successfully loaded!" messages, making it more accessible for the user to navigate the list.

    Is there something we all want, need, and dream of - but none of us have? Exactly: money. With this sad and yet relatable idea in mind, the following project aimed to offer a humble application allowing hypothetical users to estimate the price of a website, as well as obtain a desirable response according to the options they chose and their different prices.

    Independently of the apparent simplicity of the project, it allows for interacting more directly with the client as we are taking into account their choices and preferences, and also providing them with tools for a smoother experience, such as:

    1. a search bar.
    2. buttons sorting their saved lists by date and name.
    3. an individualized deleting system for each list created.
    4. the possibility of clearing all their saved budgets at once.
    5. a pagination system focused on making their saved data more accessible.
    6. the possibility of keeping their budget options saved in the URL.
    
    By combining all of these elements, we delivered if not a great tool (note that this was the creator's second React project, so of course it was not good at all!), at least an intuitive one.

    The following project consisted of an application capable of showing different quotes and accordingly switching the background images just so the hypothetical client of a fictional company can see an initial approximation of the prototype we were supposed to work on. 
    
    Considering that one of the objectives was consistently displaying the different quotes and images, we used [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) as the base of our project, a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. Thanks to it, it was possible to implement a Welcome screen, as well as a first component consisting of an array with two different properties:
    
    1. img, which stored the background images that should be displayed on the screen.
    2. txt, which contained four different quotes.

    In order to customize the assignment, however, I decided to include new designs and quotes extracted from the [Tao Te Ching](https://terebess.hu/english/tao/gia.html) while still respecting the basis of the project; the objective, in this case, varied from telling a story to providing the user with some meaningful and philosophical quotes.

    It would have been impossible for me to achieve this result if it wasn't thanks to incredibly talented illustrators such as [Helvetica Blanc](https://helveticablanc.com/), the creator behind the artwork that illustrates this application. If you still don't know their work, please, have a look at it (it's simply amazing; you have my word!) - and try your best to support (in any way possible) these creators with such a unique vision of reality.

    Hypothesis: A company in the audiovisual sector has asked us for a web application that will allow their employees to quickly find movies from a large database they have, since the process is currently done manually.
    
    You will be in charge of setting up the core of the application: all the logic of filtering and sorting of movies. You have 2 weeks to finish, which is how long this sprint lasts. 2015 and 2017, I was co-designing and leading the UI design & development for various web properties of ChartMogul. I played a key role in creating a components-based UI design system and incorporating it across all web touchpoints.

    The problem is that, even though no one truly asked me to do this, I decided to add a minimal Bootstrap landing page just so I could both explore new designs and express my gratitude to:
    
    1. Auregan Nedelec
    2. Freepik project

    As a first contact with JavaScript, IT Academy told us that a company in the e-commerce sector asked for a web application allowing them to offer the purchase of their products through the internet. 
    
    After interiorizing some essential notions regarding web design thanks to the first sprints, we will now be in charge of setting up an initial demo version of the application for the client: management of the shopping cart and the application of the promotions on the final price.

    These were the prototypes we had to work with:
    
    1. the main site, providing users with functionalities such as adding products to the cart or showing a modal that includes the products they bought, their individual prices and the total one.
    2. a checkout page with a proper validation system accepting certain conditions, depending on the field; if these conditions are not met, it doesn't allow the user to submit their form until all tests have been passed.
    
    Even though IT Academy came up with an already-made design, I decided to add some minimal changes while still respecting the requirements and expected features.

    What is a UI library? How about Bootstrap and SASS? Why should I consider using this software system (or toolchain) that comes with a collection of components that could make my life way easier? 
    
    Although the first and second questions are completely understandable when we're just starting to dive into this immense area of knowledge, getting in touch with Bootstrap's definition pointing it as one of the most popular CSS frameworks for developing responsive and mobile-first websites should be a reason enough to, at least, give it a try - and that's what we did.
    
    Once we thoroughly studied these new realities, their usage, and advantages, IT Academy proposed a project consisting of replicating A simple bookmark manager.
    
    The entire landing page incorporated:
    
    1. the main content with its corresponding navbar.
    2. a features section explaining the most remarkable characteristics of this (fictional) tool.
    3. a download section including Chrome, Firefox, and Opera versions of the extension.
    4. a FAQS section that allowed us to incorporate an accordion component.
    5. a footer with a Contact us area that would throw an error whenever the form receives an empty email address or an invalid one.
